# rack-mini-profiler

This is an opinionated fork of the wonderful 
[MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler][0].  Designed for use at [Figma][3], but 
hopefully useful externally!

This fork dramatically simplifies the UI (at the cost of removing many 
features), adds support for recording sampling profiles using [stackprof][1] on 
all requests, and displaying them in an embedded copy of [speedscope][2].

Since this was written, however, the upstream `rack-mini-profiler` now also embeds speedscope! https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler/pull/475

This work was heavily inspired by the work done for a similar use case at Khan 
Academy: [gae_mini_profiler][4], in particular the [work done by 
@chrisklaiber][5] to add an embedded copy of Chrome Developer Tools.
